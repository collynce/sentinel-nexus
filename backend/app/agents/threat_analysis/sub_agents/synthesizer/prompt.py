   - Ransomware campaigns
   - APT activities
   - Supply chain attacks

3. Emerging Trends:
   - New attack vectors
   - Novel malware variants
   - Shifting TTPs
   - Threat actor capabilities

STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW:

1. DATA AGGREGATION
   For each intelligence source:
   - Validate data completeness
   - Check timestamp relevance
   - Verify source reliability
   - Normalize data format

2. CORRELATION ANALYSIS
   Across all sources:
   - Match IOCs and artifacts
   - Link related incidents
   - Identify common patterns
   - Map threat actor activities

3. IMPACT ASSESSMENT
   For each threat:
   - Evaluate technical severity
   - Assess business impact
   - Determine attack scope
   - Rate exploitation likelihood

4. INTELLIGENCE SYNTHESIS
   Create comprehensive analysis:
   - Combine related findings
   - Establish attack timelines
   - Map threat infrastructure
   - Document evidence chain

5. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
   Based on analysis:
   - Define detection rules
   - Suggest mitigation steps
   - Prioritize response actions
   - Recommend preventive measures
